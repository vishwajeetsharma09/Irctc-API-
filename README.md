Railway Management System API
Overview
This API project simulates a railway management system similar to IRCTC, allowing users to register, login, manage trains, check seat availability, and book seats. It includes role-based access control with admin and user roles.

Features
User Management: Register and login functionalities.
Admin Operations: Add new trains and update seat availability.
User Actions: Check train availability, book seats, and view booking details.
JWT Authentication: Secure API endpoints using JSON Web Tokens.
MySQL Database: Store and manage train and user data efficiently.
Concurrency Handling: Handle simultaneous booking requests to prevent overbooking.
Tech Stack
Node.js and Express.js: Backend server and routing framework.
MySQL: Database management system for storing data.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Authentication and authorization mechanism.
dotenv: Environment variable management.
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Node.js (version >= 12.x)
MySQL database
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd Irctc-API
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Database Setup:

Create a MySQL database.
Configure database connection details in a .env file:
makefile
Copy code
DATABASE_HOST=localhost
DATABASE_USER=root
DATABASE_PASS=your_mysql_password
DATABASE_NAME=irctc
Run Migrations:

Use Knex CLI to run migrations:
bash
Copy code
npx knex migrate:latest
Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the root directory with the following variables:
makefile
Copy code
DATABASE_HOST=localhost
DATABASE_USER=root
DATABASE_PASS=your_mysql_password
DATABASE_NAME=irctc
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_access_token_secret
API_KEY=your_api_key
Start the Server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The server should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

API Endpoints
POST /register: Register a new user.
POST /login: Authenticate and receive a JWT token.
POST /addtrain: Add a new train (admin access).
GET /trains?source=<source>&destination=<destination>: Get trains between source and destination.
POST /book: Book a seat on a train (authenticated users).
GET /bookings: Get specific booking details (authenticated users).
Authentication
JWT Token: Secure API endpoints using JSON Web Tokens. Obtain a token via the /login endpoint.
Testing
Use Postman or any API testing tool to send requests to the endpoints.
Include the appropriate headers (Content-Type and Authorization) with JWT token for authenticated requests.
Test each endpoint for expected behavior:
User registration and login.
Adding a new train (admin).
Checking train availability.
Booking a seat.
Retrieving booking details.
Error Handling
Proper error responses are sent for invalid requests or unauthorized access.
Middleware and route-specific error handling ensure robust API behavior.
Deployment
Deploy the application to a cloud platform like AWS, Heroku, or Azure for production use.
Configure environment variables in your cloud provider's dashboard.
